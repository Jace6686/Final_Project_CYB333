# Final_Project_CYB333
build a tool that would evaluate the strength of passwords against attack patterns and that would provide suggestions for improving password security. I aim for this tool to analyze the structure of a password, looking for weaknesses such as simple patterns, common phrases, or easy-to-guess sequences


Key objectives and features of the project are:
Password Evaluation: To analyze password length, complexity, and randomness against best practices for secure passwords.
Known Attack Pattern Detection: To identify common password weaknesses like dictionary words, keyboard patterns (e.g., "123456"), or simple substitutions (e.g., "password" â†’ "P@ssw0rd").
Feedback and Recommendations: To provide actionable suggestions on how to strengthen the password, including adding complexity or avoiding easily guessable patterns.
Breach Check: To check the password against a public database of leaked passwords to see if it has been compromised.
Scoring System: To provide a password strength score (e.g., weak, moderate, strong) based on the analysis.
